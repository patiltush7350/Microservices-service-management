# 🚀 Microservices Service Management

Welcome to the Microservices Service Management repository! This project employs a microservices architecture to offer scalability, flexibility, and modularity.

## Components

The following components constitute this project:

- **🌐 ApiGateway**: Serves as the central entry point for client requests, efficiently routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **⚙️ ConfigServer**: Centralizes configuration management for various microservices, simplifying setup and maintenance.
- **🏨 HotelService**: Facilitates hotel-related functionalities like booking, availability, and pricing management.
- **⭐ RatingService**: Manages user ratings and reviews for hotels or other services within the system.
- **🔍 ServiceRegistry**: Offers service discovery and registration capabilities for microservices, ensuring seamless communication.
- **👤 User service**: Handles user-related functionalities such as authentication, authorization, and user profiles management.

## Installation and Setup

To run the microservices system locally, follow these steps:

1. 📥 Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. 💻 Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
3. 🛠️ Navigate to each microservice directory (e.g., `ApiGateway`, `ConfigServer`, etc.) and follow the setup instructions provided in their respective README files.
4. 🚀 Once all microservices are set up and running, you can interact with the system.

## Usage

After setting up the microservices, you can utilize the system for managing services, booking hotels, retrieving user ratings, and other functionalities provided by the microservices. Interaction with the system can be done via HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints exposed by each microservice.
