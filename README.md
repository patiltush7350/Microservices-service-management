# Microservices Service Management

This repository contains the source code for a microservices-based service management system. The system is designed using a microservices architecture to provide scalability, flexibility, and modularity.

## Components

The following are the components included in this project:

- **ApiGateway**: Acts as a central entry point for client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **ConfigServer**: Manages the configuration of various microservices, enabling centralized configuration management.
- **HotelService**: Manages hotel-related functionalities such as booking, availability, and pricing.
- **RatingService**: Handles tasks related to user ratings and reviews for hotels or other services within the system.
- **ServiceRegistry**: Provides service discovery and registration capabilities for microservices.
- **User service**: Manages user-related functionalities such as authentication, authorization, and user profiles.

## Installation and Setup

To run the microservices system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, as the microservices are typically implemented in Spring Boot.
3. Navigate to each microservice directory (e.g., `ApiGateway`, `ConfigServer`, etc.) and follow the setup instructions provided in their respective README files.
4. Once all microservices are set up and running, you can interact with the system.

## Usage

After setting up the microservices, you can use the system for managing services, booking hotels, retrieving user ratings, and other functionalities provided by the microservices. Interaction with the system can be done via HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints exposed by each microservice.
